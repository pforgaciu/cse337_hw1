# This script implements printing ofthe �99 Bottles of Beer� song. Through this
# exercise, you will learn ruby program naming conventions, some simple ruby oo
# concepts, GIT version control and problem solving in ruby. Assume that your
# console is a wall # where the song will be written once your code executes. For
# example, for initial 99 # bottles, the wall should write �
#*************** Program output ***************************
# 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer
# take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
# 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer
# take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
# 97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer
# take one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.
...
# 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer
# take one down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
# 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer
# take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

it also changes internal state of the object by changing number of bottles. For this, it may call private method defined later.
